# Android ViewModel & State Management

Follow [Android Architecture Recommendations](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/recommendations) (strongly recommended).

## Instructions

Use `ViewModel` to hold state and business logic. It must outlive configuration changes.

### 1. UI State (StateFlow) — Single Source of Truth
*   **What**: Represents all UI state the screen needs (e.g., `Loading`, `Success(data)`, `Error`, snackbar message, navigation target).
*   **Type**: `StateFlow<UiState>`.
*   **Initialization**: Must have an initial value.
*   **Exposure**: Expose as read-only `StateFlow`. For streams from data layer, use `stateIn(scope, SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed(5000), initialValue)`.
    ```kotlin
    // From repository stream
    val uiState: StateFlow<NewsFeedUiState> = newsRepository
        .getNewsStream()
        .mapToUiState()
        .stateIn(
            scope = viewModelScope,
            started = SharingStarted.WhileSubscribed(5_000),
            initialValue = NewsFeedUiState.Loading
        )

    // Or for mutable state
    private val _uiState = MutableStateFlow<UiState>(UiState.Loading)
    val uiState: StateFlow<UiState> = _uiState.asStateFlow()
    ```
*   **Updates**: Use `.update { oldState -> ... }` for thread safety.
*   **Single property**: Prefer one `uiState`; multiple unrelated properties are acceptable when justified.

### 2. Do NOT Send Events from ViewModel to UI (Strongly Recommended)
*   **Process events immediately in the ViewModel** and update state with the result.
*   **Avoid** `SharedFlow` / `Channel` for one-off events (toast, snackbar, navigation). Model them as state instead.
*   **Pattern**: Snackbar, toast, navigation target → include in `UiState`. UI observes state, reacts, then calls ViewModel to clear/consume.
    ```kotlin
    data class UiState(
        val items: List<Item>,
        val isLoading: Boolean = false,
        val snackbarMessage: String? = null  // UI shows, then calls onSnackbarDismissed
    )

    fun onSnackbarDismissed() {
        _uiState.update { it.copy(snackbarMessage = null) }
    }
    ```
*   **Reference**: [Handle ViewModel events](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer/events#handle-viewmodel-events).

### 3. Lifecycle-Aware Collection in UI
*   **Compose**: Always use `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()` for `StateFlow`.
    ```kotlin
    val state by viewModel.uiState.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()
    ```
*   **Views (XML)**: Use `repeatOnLifecycle(Lifecycle.State.STARTED)` within a coroutine.

### 4. ViewModel Constraints (Strongly Recommended)
*   **Agnostic of Android lifecycle**: Do not hold `Activity`, `Fragment`, `Context`, or `Resources`. Use standard `ViewModel`, not `AndroidViewModel`.
*   **Screen-level only**: Use ViewModels for screen composables, Activities/Fragments, or navigation destinations—not in reusable UI components.
*   **Reusable UI**: Use plain state holder classes (not ViewModels) for complex reusable components; hoist state externally.

### 5. Scope
*   Use `viewModelScope` for all coroutines started by the ViewModel.
*   Delegate operations to UseCases or Repositories where appropriate.

### 6. Handling ApiResult / Result from repository

*   **fold**: use when you need to **use the returned data** — get one value (both success and failure return/transform to the same type).
*   **onSuccess / onFailure**: use to **transform or handle the result** per branch; when you don't need a single value from the result, use onSuccess/onFailure.

Example: need one value → `val x = result.fold(onSuccess = { it }, onFailure = { null })`. Only side effects → `result.onSuccess { ... }.onFailure { ... }`.

*   **Use `fold`** when you need to **produce a single value** (e.g. assign to `_uiState.value`) and **both** success and failure branches **return that same type** (e.g. `UiState.Success(data)` vs `UiState.Error(message)`).
*   **Use `onSuccess` / `onFailure`** when you only need **side effects** (update state per branch, set snackbar in state, etc.) and do **not** need one derived value.
